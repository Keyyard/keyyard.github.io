## Overview

This is the first Discovery post. The Discovery section is where I will publish downloadable projects, tools, and community contributions.

## For users

- Browse projects and tools in one place — thumbnails and short descriptions make it easy to find what you need.
- Download links are provided per-post; paid assets link to secure hosts and free samples may be directly downloadable.
- Each post includes usage notes, screenshots, and basic troubleshooting tips so you can get up and running quickly.

## For clients

- Looking for custom work or commercial licenses? Use the Contact section to request a quote or start a discussion.
- Premium work (paid add-ons, enterprise integrations) will be delivered via secure download links and include license terms.
- I can provide custom development, white-labeling, or integration work — include requirements and timelines when you reach out.

## Installation

No installation is required to read posts — they are static pages on this site. If a post includes a downloadable asset, the frontmatter `download` field will point to an external URL where you can get the file.

## Usage

Use the Discovery index to browse projects. Click any item to open the full post where you'll find usage instructions, screenshots, and a download link if provided.

## Contributing

- If you want to contribute (bug reports, patches, or small assets), open an issue or a pull request on the corresponding GitHub repository linked in the post.
- For community-contributed assets, include a short README and a clear license so others know how to use your work.

## Contact & Support

- For general questions or help with a post, use the Contact section on the main site or open an issue if the project has a GitHub repo.
- For business inquiries (sponsorships, licensing, custom development), email [keyyard8888@gmail.com](mailto:keyyard8888@gmail.com) with a subject like "Discovery — Request" and include a short project brief.

## License & Download

Each post should include licensing information or a link to the license inside the Markdown content. For paid or large downloads I will provide external links; for small free samples a direct download link may be included.
